# Chinese Address Normalizer

This is a tool for normalizing Chinese address, also good for address correction. I build a Trie for searching and use Levenshtein distance to find the best matches. This work is modified based on [chinese-address](https://github.com/zck921031/chinese-address) by [zck921031](https://github.com/zck921031).
